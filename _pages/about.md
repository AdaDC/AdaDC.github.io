I am a data scientist with 8+ years of experience in academic research and industry settings. My strong foundation in statistics and psychology allows me to approach data challenges with both analytical rigor and an understanding of human behavior. I specialize in data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and advanced data visualization to uncover actionable insights.

With expertise in Big Data technologies and handling messy, real-world datasets, I thrive in solving complex problems and delivering impactful solutions. My work spans a variety of domains, including machine learning, predictive analytics, and data storytelling, and I aim to make data science accessible and impactful in both technical and business contexts.
